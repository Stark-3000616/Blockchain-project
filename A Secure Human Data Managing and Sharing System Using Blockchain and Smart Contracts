# Blockchain-project
A Secure Human Data Managing and Sharing System Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts
 This project focuses on user data management using blockchain technology and smart contract. The proposed
solution utilizes the key features of blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts to achieve a decentralized, trusted,
and secure solution that puts the users back in Control via a distributed trust model. The main features of the
proposed solution include unauthorized access of personal data, upload of personal data, and requesting access
for the access of data.
The main goal of this project is to generate unique id for any person which
will replace all the physical identity cards in this world
 to increase security and prevent data breach.
 There are broadly two parts of this project,
 one is user authentication 
 and the other was user access. 
 In the user authentication part there is 2sa algorithm.
